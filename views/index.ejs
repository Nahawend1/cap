        <p class="text-center">
          The Palestinian-Israeli conflict is a conflict over land, how much or how
          little should each group. A common myth is that this conflict is due to
          religion-a fight between Jews and Muslims- but this isn’t the case, there
          are also Christian Palestinians who are being oppressed. This conflict is
          about expelling Arabs from their land. Each side has their different
          reasons for why they should have the land but something we shouldn’t allow
          is the oppression and apartheid of Palestinians. Palestinians have been
          forcefully removed from their land and placed into specified zones, like
          the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, while the Israeli government allows
          Israelis to use the land. Palestinians are unable to freely move through
          the land, they can only be in Arab designated zones, created by the
          Israeli government. Both Palestinian Muslims and Christians are regularly
          repressed from visiting their places of worship. This issue should concern
          the globe, but particularly Americans because our tax dollars go to
          funding the Israeli government and military, we contribute to the
          apartheid of Palestinians. We should be aware of where our tax dollars are
          going and condemn the blatant violation of human rights in Palestine.
