                    <p>The Balfour Declaration was a public statement by the British government during WWI supporting a "national home for the Jewish people" in Palestine. The 
                  declaration was signed by Arthur Balfour, a British foreign Secratary, who "offered sympathy" to the Jewish Zionist's aspriations. Zionism was a political
                  colonial movement that emerged in <b>Europe</b> in the 19th century that sought to create a Jewish national home in Palestine, which was inhabited by
                  Palestinians.
                    <br> With the help of the British, Zionists were able to migrate Jews from Europe to inhabited Palestine.

                    In November 1947, the UN passed a resolution to expand Zionist territory from 6% currently conqured to 56% of historic Palestine.
                    The Zionist movement launched 'Plan Dalet'to kick Palestinians by any means necessary, resulting in 80% of Palestinians colonized.

                    <p> The Oslo Accords are mulitple agreements between Israel and the PLO aiming to establish some sort of negotiations. 
                   Within the agreements, Israel maintains control of the borders, security, and authority over imports/exports, and overall
                  Palestinian connection with the outside world.

                  The Oslo Accords were established to be a framework for future negotiations, intending to last 5 years. 30 years later, a final agreement hasn't
                  been reached and Israeli control is still in full force.
